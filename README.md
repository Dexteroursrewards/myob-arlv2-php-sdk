AccountRight Live (V2) PHP SDK
==============================

**The SDK is in early development, only authentication and some basic read endpoints have been completed**.

This is a PHP SDK for interacting with the MYOB AccountRight Live V2 API. 
It is intended to support all of the [AccountRight Live](http://developer.myob.com/api/accountright/v2/)
endpoints. More in depth documentation is on the roadmap.
